# Cloud & DevOps Automation Portfolio

Welcome to my Cloud & DevOps automation portfolio!  
This repository contains scripts, tools, and Infrastructure-as-Code modules I’ve built and used in real-world projects across Azure, DevOps, IIS, Kubernetes, and automation workflows.

I created this repository to share practical solutions, learnings, and reusable code for engineers working with cloud infrastructure and DevOps pipelines.
